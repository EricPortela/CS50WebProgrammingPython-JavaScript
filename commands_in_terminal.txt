Good commands to know


1. GENERAL COMMANDS 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cd <directPath> 
==> Change directory to a certain path/folder, etc 

ls 
==> list all of the files and folders inside of the current directory

touch 
==> create a new file inside of a directory
==> e.g. touch hello.html will create a .html-file named hello in the current directory we are located inside of

open
==> open a file for example 
==> e.g. open hello.html will open the html file in the web browser 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------




2. CSS/SCSS (SASS) related
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sass name.scss:name.css 
==> compile the .scss file and generate a .css file
==> needs to be done in order for the web browser to handle .scss files, since it can not by default compile .scss
==> remember to link the .css-file in HTML, NOT the .scss-file (wonÂ´t work otherwise)


sass --watch name.scss:name.css
==> add a watch to the .scss-file and make the .css-file update accordingly
==> is used instead of having to recompile the .scss-file and having to create a new .css-file every time
------------------------------------------------------------------------------




3. GIT-related
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git clone <url>
==> clone a repository by its url
==> a local copy of the repo will be created 
==> url can either be https or ssh, which are accessed through the GitHub repo
==> https/ssh are essentially two different ways of authentication
